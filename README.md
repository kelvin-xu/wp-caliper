# wp-caliper

Sends Caliper events to LRS (tested against IMS Global Learning Consortium Member Caliper Analyticsâ„¢
Conformance Test Suite). Some features are ONLY enabled if the dependent plugins have also been installed.
The plugin can be used as a MU plugin as well.

### Setup Plugin

See [readme.txt](readme.txt) for setup instructions.


### Settings

`WP_CALIPER_DEFAULT_ACTOR_HOMEPAGE` set the base url for the Caliper actor's IRI (default `http://www.ubc.ca`).
